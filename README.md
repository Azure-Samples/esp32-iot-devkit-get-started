## Get Started with ESP32 Devices

For first-time users of ESP32 devices, follow these quick steps to:
- Prepare your development environment.
- Send information from the device to the Azure IoT Hub 
- Listen to cloud to device message with ESP32

## What you learn

* How to install the development environment.
* How to create an IoT Hub and register a ESP32 device.
* How to send sample data to your IoT hub.

## What you need

* A ESP32 device. 

  > **[NOTE]
  > We use [M5Stack](www.m5stack.com) in this tutorial, but the steps below could also be applied to other ESP32 devices.**
  
* A computer running Windows 10 or macOS 10.10+.
* An active Azure subscription. [Activate a free 30-day trial Microsoft Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

## Prepare your hardware

For M5Stack, please follow the [guide](http://www.m5stack.com/assets/docs/index.html) to prepare the hardware.

## Install development environment

We recommend [Azure IoT Device Workbench](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.vscode-iot-workbench) extension for Visual Studio Code to develop on the ESP32 devices.

Azure IoT Device Workbench provides an integrated experience to develop IoT solutions. It helps both on device and cloud development using Azure IoT and other services. You can watch this [Channel9 video](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Internet-of-Things-Show/IoT-Workbench-extension-for-VS-Code) to have an overview of what it does.

Follow these steps to prepare the development environment for ESP32 devices:

1. Download and install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). It provides the necessary toolchain for compiling and uploading Arduino code.
   * Windows: Use Windows Installer version
   * macOS: Drag and drop the Arduino into `/Applications`
   * Ubuntu: Unzip it into `$HOME/Downloads/arduino-1.8.5`

2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a cross platform source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging.

3. Look for **Azure IoT Device Workbench** in the extension marketplace and install it.
    ![Install IoT Device Workbench](media/esp32-get-started/install-workbench.png)
    Together with the IoT Device Workbench, other dependent extensions will be installed.

4. Open **File > Preference > Settings** and add following lines to configure Arduino.

	* Windows

		```JSON
		"arduino.path": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Arduino",
		"arduino.additionalUrls": "https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json"
		```

	* macOS

		```JSON
		"arduino.path": "/Application",
		"arduino.additionalUrls": "https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json"
		```

	* Ubuntu

		```JSON
		"arduino.path": "/home/{username}/Downloads/arduino-1.8.5",
		"arduino.additionalUrls": "https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json"
		```

5. Use `F1` or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (macOS: `Cmd+Shift+P`) to open the command palette, type and select **Arduino: Board Manager**. Search for **esp32** and install the latest version.

## Build your first project

Now you are all set with preparing and configuring your development environment. Let us build a "Hello World" sample for IoT: sending simulated telemetry data to Azure IoT Hub.
Make sure your device is **not connected** to your computer. Start VS Code first, and then connect the ESP32 device to your computer.

## Open the project folder

### Open Azure IoT Device Workbench Examples

Use `F1` or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (macOS: `Cmd+Shift+P`) to open the command palette, type **Azure IoT Device Workbench**, and then select **Open Examples...**.

![IoT Device Workbench: Examples](media/iot-workbench-examples-cmd.png)

Select **ESP32 Arduino**.

![IoT Device Workbench: Examples -> Select board](media/iot-workbench-examples-board.png)

Then the **IoT Device Workbench Example** window is shown up.

![IoT Device Workbench, Examples window](media/iot-workbench-examples.png)

Find **ESP32 Get Started** and click **Open Sample** button. A new VS Code window with a project folder in it opens.

![IoT Device Workbench, select ESP32 Get Started example](media/esp32-get-started/open-example-esp32getstarted.jpg)

### Provision Azure service

In the solution window, open the command palette and select **Azure IoT Device Workbench: Cloud: Provision Azure Services...**.

![IoT Device Workbench: Cloud -> Provision](media/iot-workbench-cloud-provision.png)

Then VS Code guides you through provisioning the required Azure services.

![IoT Device Workbench: Cloud -> Provision steps](media/iot-workbench-cloud-provision-steps2.png)

The whole process includes:
* Select an existing IoT Hub or create a new IoT Hub.
* Select an existing IoT Hub device or create a new IoT Hub device. 

### Config Device Code

1. Open the source file(.ino) for device code and update the following lines with your WiFi ssid and password:
    ```csharp
		// Please input the SSID and password of WiFi
		const char* ssid     = "";
		const char* password = "";
    ```

2. Open the command palette and select **Azure IoT Device Workbench: Config Device Settings...**.

   ![IoT Device Workbench: Device -> Settings](media/iot-workbench-device-settings.png)

3. Select **Copy device connection string**.

	![IoT Device Workbench: Device copy connection string](media/esp32-get-started/copy-connection-string.png)

   This copies the connection string that is retrieved from the `Provision Azure services` step.

4. Paste the device connection string into the following line in device code
    ```csharp
	/*String containing Hostname, Device Id & Device Key in the format:                         */
	/*  "HostName=<host_name>;DeviceId=<device_id>;SharedAccessKey=<device_key>"                */
	/*  "HostName=<host_name>;DeviceId=<device_id>;SharedAccessSignature=<device_sas_token>"    */
	static const char* connectionString = "";
    ```

### Build and upload the device code

1. Open the command palette and select **Azure IoT Device Workbench: Upload Device Code**.

	![IoT Device Workbench: Device -> Upload](media/iot-workbench-device-upload.png)

2. VS Code then starts verifying and uploading the code to your DevKit.

	![IoT Device Workbench: Device -> Uploaded](media/esp32-get-started/esp32-device-uploaded.png)

3. The ESP32 device reboots and starts running the code.

## Test the project

### Send D2C message

Open serial monitor:

The sample application is running successfully when you see the following results:

* The Serial Monitor displays the message sent to the IoT Hub.

![azure-iot-toolkit-output-console](media/esp32-get-started/monitor-d2c-message.png)

### Listen to C2D message

You can send message to your device with Azure Portal or other API. Please Make sure that serial monitor is open. Then you can see the message content from serial monitor.
